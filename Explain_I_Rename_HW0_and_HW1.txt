I need to use GitHub Desktop when I submit Homework 2. But due to the incorrect 
naming of Homework 0 and Homework 1, I cannot use GitHub Desktop application to 
push and commit Homework 2's files to remote repository.

I submitted both Homework 0 and Homework 1 on time. You can find the evidence in 
my screenshot Why_I_Rename_HW0_and_HW1.jpg.

So, I renamed Homework 0 and Homework 1, so that Homework 2 can use GitHub Desktop
application to push and commit its files to remote repository normally.
